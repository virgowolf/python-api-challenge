# python-api-challenge
Python script was used to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
Includes a representative model of weather across cities with regression analyses.
Weather data was then analyzed to select ideal vacation destinations based on maximum temperatures, cloudiness, and wind speed. I utilized Jupyter Notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and Geoapify API. Lastly, I received coding support from UC Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp, including TA Marc Karam, and the Ed X Virtual Assistant.
